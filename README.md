# Derivative Simulator
Made by James Davidson and Aidan Ladmore.

## What is it?
Derivative Simulator is a web-based JavaScript application that graphs common mathematical functions and their derivative functions.

## What does it do?
Derivative Simulator allows the user to plot some mathematical functions on a number plane, as well as their derivative functions.

The base function can be transformed using sliders that control parameters such as vertical shift, horizontal shift and gradient/concavity.

## What functions does Derivative Simulator support?
- Linear functions
- Parabolas
- Cubics
- Hyperbolas
