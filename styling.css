/* 
The background for the index.html file is 1920x1080. It is further cut horizontally into two equal halves
(such that each half is 1920x540). There will be 4 images displayed in the lower half, each with dimensions 300x300.

The HORIZONTAL spacing between each image and the edges of the background is 144px.
The VERTICAL spacing between the top and bottom part of the half is 120px.

The lower half of the page should look something like this:

--- 144 | 300 | 144 | 300 | 144 | 300 | 144 | 300 | 144 ---
120  x     x     x     x     x     x     x     x     x  120
---                                                     ---
300  x   image   x   image   x   image   x   image   x  300
---                                                     ---
120  x     x     x     x     x     x     x     x     x  120
--- 144 | 300 | 144 | 300 | 144 | 300 | 144 | 300 | 144 ---

Please take this into account when doing padding in CSS. Keep in mind each image will be a clickable hyperlink.

That's all for now,
James
